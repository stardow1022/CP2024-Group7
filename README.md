# CP2024; Midterm Project
## Subject
Exact calculation for Ising model in several lattices (a two-student group can work only on 2) and 3))
1) Honeycomb lattice
2) Kagome lattice
3) Simple cubic lattice

## Key points to be addressed
1) Behaviors of thermodynamic observables (see the lecture notes) studied for several system sizes; the largest system size may vary depending on the efficiency of the code
2) How each lattice structure is implemented
3) (* very important *) How the correctness of the implementation is verified
4) How the teamwork is organized
5) (etc.)

## Remarks
1) Use a test framework
2) Try to follow the test-driven development (TDD) approach as much as you can
3) Set up the continuous integration (CI) using GitHub Action as soon as possible
